Project delivered: full project files for RagNaroks-Hearth-v1 (backend, web, mobile, database, CI).
Next recommended immediate steps:
1) Copy these files into a repo or have your coworker paste them into a machine.
2) Create backend/.env with DATABASE_URL and JWT_SECRET from .env.example.
3) Run SQL files against a Postgres DB.
4) npm install in backend/web/mobile and start services.

If you want:
- a Dockerfile + docker-compose for local dev,
- socket.io realtime integration (server + client hooks),
- formatted export as a downloadable ZIP (I can't create direct downloads here, but I can produce a combined single-file archive text you can save and unzip on a machine),
- or push these directly to a GitHub repo if you grant me repository write access (add GitHub Copilot app with write permission to repo and tell me the owner/repo), 

tell me which and I’ll produce it next.
